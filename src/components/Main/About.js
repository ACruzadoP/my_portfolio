                        Hello there! My name is Alberto and technically, I am a Technician in Computer Applications Development. The reason why I said "technicaly" is that I have never considered myself a true developer - mainly because I have never officially worked as such but also, because every time I have talked to a profesional, I have realized how little I know. 
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        I have had all sort of jobs to be honest, but never as a developer. I enjoy every time I manage to develop a piece of software, so far with the only purpose of having fun, but that's all.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                        With that said, feel free to check out my little (but not insignificant) works. I trully hope you enjoy 'em all! =)
