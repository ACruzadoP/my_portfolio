        "text": "After having completed high school, I studied 'FormaciÃ³n Profesional de Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones InformÃ¡ticas'. During the 1st year, I had to learn C programming language and had to complete some exercises with STB libraries. The second year consisted of two stages - during the 1st one, I had to learn C# and during the 2nd one, I had to do company practices, where I got to learn Visual Basic. \nAs soon as I completed the company practices, I tried to study Telecommunications Engineering - unfortunately, that was not a Degree you can simply complete by 'giving it a try'... so I ended up dropping out, but not before having learned Java programming language as well as having developed a game of Othello where you could play against the machine on diferent levels of difficulty. \nUnfotunately, the laptop where I had all these exercises burnt while playing a game called 'Lineage II' and I didn't have any backup because, at that time, I was a complete mess. ðŸ˜¢"

If you don't know what a bot is, it's a tool that allows your character to reach a high level a lot faster. The bot had standalone features and allowed you to load scripts as well. For the 1st time, I managed to use my programming skills for recreational purposes. In order to develop these scripts, I had to get familiarized with a made-up programming language called Jing-Jing. \nFeel free to check out the scripts I developed - L2NET_LINK"

My work permit was about to expire and the Canadian government refused to give me another one. I asked the company I was working at to give me a job offer, so that I could apply to another visa called 'Young Professionals'. After having received the job offer, I decided to spend a winter in Spain while waiting for that new visa request to be approved. Please feel free to check more about 'International Experience Canada' - IEC_LINK \nI was so grateful for having received the job offer that I used the waiting time in order to develop a tool using C# programming language. This tool was meant to analyze the Text Files of any game and locate inconsistencies related to the use of variables and numeric characters. \nDon't hesitate to check out the software - LQA_LINK"

This company caught my attention because most of their workers were working remotely, and a work I could perform at home was a nice way for me to go back to Spain, without having to look for a job afterwards. I had to do an exam to show them that I was eligible for the position and became a  'Customer Support Agent' right away. Later on, the position would be called 'Player Support Agent' instead, but it was basically the same thing. I was working as 'PS Agent' for almost 3 years and then I was promoted to 'Player Support Shift Lead'. Needless to say, I was extremely happy for my very first promotion. \nWorking on CRM (Customer Relationship Management) was a great opportunity to continue developing pieces of software, not only to make my life easier, but also because I'm weird enough to enjoy while developing software! ðŸ˜„ \n\nPlease feel free to check out the stuff I managed to develop: \n- Reply builder - RB_LINK \n- Google App Scripts - GS_LINK"

        "text": "COVID arrived and it was time for me to create a Portfolio, for showing all the little projects that I had worked on. To do so, I had to learn React, JavaScript, Git and Sass. I knew HTML already, as well as a bit of CSS, but I had to learn them again as I kinda forgot them. Also, I learned a bit of Redux, but I didn't get to implement it in the Portfolio, yet. \nBy the way, the Portfolio that I'm referring to, is the one that you're currently looking at. ðŸ˜…\n\nOnce the Portfolio was good enough to be shared, I started looking for jobs in the IT industry - and I managed to start working at a company called Unit4, as Associate Quality Manager. A position I held for 2 years, before being promoted to a standalone Quality Manager. I won't talk much about my experience working at Unit4, but I will just say that they were kind enough to let me spend some time learning about Automation testing, specifically about Selenium and Specflow. I could add a 6th Phase to talk about what I managed to learn while working at Unit4, but I won't. \nWith that said, I left some features to be implemented in the Portfolio such as the Text that you're currently reading (the one for 5th Phase), a language selector, the implementation of Redux and probably some Automated tests. Also, I wanted to know how it was to resume the portfolio after, hopefully some years working at Unit4, and not remembering much about the code I wrote."
