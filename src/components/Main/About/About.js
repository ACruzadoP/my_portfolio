                                Hello there! My name is Alberto and I love spending time developing once in a while. A few years ago, I studied to become a Technician in Computer Applications Development.
                            </p><br />
                            <p>
                                &nbsp;I have never considered myself a true developer - mainly because I have never officially worked as such but also, because every time I have talked to a profesional developer, I have realized how little I know. I have worked doing so many other things, but never as a developer.
                            </p><br />
                            <p>
                                &nbsp;I enjoy every time I manage to develop a piece of software, so far with the only purpose of having fun, but that's all. With that said, feel free to check out my little projects.
                            </p><br />
                            <p>
                                &nbsp;I trully hope you enjoy 'em all! <span role="img" aria-labelledby="Cross Fingers">🤞🏼</span>
